# weatherapi

Step 1 | Development

This test you can found App\Controller\APIController from there I have made two functions in App\Services\APIManager and for their unti test write in App\Tests\ApiTest.
Note as mentioned in assignment "gets the list of the cities from Musement's API" but seems musement api domain not workgn so I took sattis array of city.


Step 2 | API design (no code required)

Ths test you can found with file "step-2-api-design.json" which is in project direcotry itself.
