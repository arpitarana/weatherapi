# weatherapi

Step 1 | Development

This test you can found App\Controller\APIController from there I have made two functions in App\Services\APIManager and for their unit test write in App\Tests\ApiTest.

Note: as mentioned in assignment "gets the list of the cities from Musement's API" but seems musement api domain not working so I took static array of cities.


Step 2 | API design (no code required)

This test you can found with file "step-2-api-design.json" which is in project direcotry itself.
